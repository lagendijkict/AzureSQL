# AzureSQL
Lately I've been learning for the Azure DP-203 exam. I regularly need to set up a SQL Server with SQL Database, so I decided to automate some of it.

I bought a Azure sandbox from Whizlabs to save some money on Azure costs. Main disadvantage is that the sandbox gets destroyed after 3 hours, so if you want to practice again after that time, you need to create a new sandbox.

## Steps to use the PowerShell script

1 Save Startup.ps1 on your computer
2 Create Whizlabs sandbox (or other brand of your liking)
3 Copy resourcegroup name
4 Open Powershell, and navigate to the folder where you stored Startup.ps1
5 Use .\Startup.ps1 command with resourcegroup name as a parameter
6 Login to your (Whizlabs) Azure account when prompted.

The Azure SQL Server is now created within your Azure subscription, an Azure SQL Database is created and filled with schemas (+ data) from your SQL files.

7 Practice time
Use Azure Data Studio (Linux/Mac) or Sql Server Management Studio (Windows) to connect to Azure SQL and run your queries.

### Other
I didn't add the SQL files to this repository, because they are part of this book:

Depending on your use case, you can straight away use TSQLV4.sql, or divide it into database creation + schema creation like I did.
